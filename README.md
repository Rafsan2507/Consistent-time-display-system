1. To build this app, first I tried to find out what is the issue with different timezone.
2. After finding out that this different timezones causes confusion among users, I started implementing the functionalities to handle different timezones with a central timezone.
3. I have used date-fns-tz to solve this issue.
4. Different system timezones causes this inconsistency. When a user order a product, it shows date and time according to their respective timezones.
5. Using date-fns-tz, I have converted different timezones to a central timezone for all.
6. I have used Nextjs, tailwind css, Shadcn UI here.
